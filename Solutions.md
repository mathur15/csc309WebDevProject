- Explain the features of your web application, the end-user and how s/he might use it.
We are continuing from the first assignment and making a front end application for the pokemon api. This application allows you to search for a pokemon, and the result gives us information(attributes) about the pokemon. Our three view include- home,search,about tab. In the search tab, the user can search for their pokemon by name or id and search result is given back in another window with pokemon attributes. The home page introduces the user on what the user can do and once the button is pressed you will be redirected to a search page.
We have included a login and sign in feature on the navbar in our front end application, as we will possibly create a database of users who can register/login and create/update/write comments about pokemon.
- A note if you plan on submitting the assignment late.
